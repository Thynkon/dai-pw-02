<!-- GETTING STARTED -->

## Getting Started

SimpFT is a simple file transfer application to upload and download files on a
server.

The client offers a `REPL` so you can type commands interactively. Options like the server address as well as the server port (on both server and client) can be specified.

You can also find the Protocol definition as a [pdf](./docs/proto.pdf) or [typst](./docs/proto.typ)

### Get the source code

First of all, download the source code:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/Thynkon/dai-pw-02
cd dai-pw-02
```

### Documentation and protocol

You will find all the information you need to use this application in this readme.

You can find the protocol definition as a [pdf](./docs/proto.pdf) or [typst](./docs/proto.typ) if you need to edit
the it. All the documentation regarding the usage of typst for the documentation
can be found under [docs/readme.md](./docs/README.md)

The CLI application is self documented and provides all the info you need for its
arguments using

```bash
java -jar simpft.jar --help
```

The code documentation is written with standard javadoc

### Prerequisites

#### Java 21

- [asdf][asdf]

  ```sh
  # Install the plugin if needed
  asdf plugin add java
  # Install
  asdf install java latest:temurin-21
  ```

- Mac (homebrew)

  ```zsh
  brew tap homebrew/cask-versions
  brew install --cask temurin@21
  ```

- Windows (winget)

  ```ps
  winget install EclipseAdoptium.Temurin.21.JDK
  ```

#### Docker setup

The application can be used with docker.

To install and use docker, follow the [official documentation](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/)

#### Github actions

If you want to test the `Github actions` on your machine, you can use [act](https://github.com/nektos/act).

Before you launch any workflow, make sure you have created the following repository secrets:

- `AUTH_TOKEN`
- `DOCKER_USERNAME`
- `DOCKER_PASSWORD`

Then, create a file named `.secrets` which should contain the following:

```env
AUTH_TOKEN=<YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN>
DOCKER_USERNAME=<USERNAME>
DOCKER_PASSWORD=<GITHUB_APPLICATION_TOKEN>
```

Finally, launch the publish workflow (which publishes the mvn package to Github registry) with the following command:

```sh
act --secret-file .secrets
```

We have created two jobs: one that publishes this app to the `Github`'s `Maven` registry and the other builds and pushes the Docker image into `Github`'s container registry.

You can launch them using the following commands:

```sh
# Publish Docker image to Github repository
act --secret-file .secrets -j build-and-push-image
# Publish .jar to Github repository
act --secret-file .secrets -j publish
```

The workflows automatically publish this project to the GitHub's `mvn` and `Docker` registries.

### Development

Use the maven wrapper to install dependencies, build and package the project.

```sh
# install the dependencies
./mvnw clean install
# build
./mvnw package
# run
java -jar target/<filename>.jar --help
```

### Usage

#### With java

Once you have all the prerequisites, including the application archive, you can
simply run the application like this:

```bash
# Run as server
java -jar simpft.jar --mode server --port 1234 --address localhost --connections 2 --root-dir /path/to/dir

# Run client
java -jar simpft.jar --mode client --port 1234 --address localhost
```

The default values are:

- Address: localhost
- Port: 1234
- Connections: 2

#### With docker

SimpFT can be run directly using java or through a docker container.

The same image can be used for the server and client.

##### Building the image

You can build the container by cloning the repository and using:

```bash
docker build . -t dai-pw-02:latest
```

Or with the [compose.yml][compose] file provided

```bash
docker compose build
```

When using compose, you can modify the file directly or override the default
parameters by providing the following environment variables.

- SERVER_ADDRESS: the address to expose (default: 127.0.0.1)
- SERVER_PORT: the port to map on the host (default: 1234)
- MAX_CONNECTIONS: the number of connections to handle in parallel (default: 2)

##### Publishing the Docker image

Even though our Docker image is automatically built and publish to Github thanks
to a custom `workflow`, you can publish it manually thanks to the following commands:

```sh
# Login to GitHub Container Registry
docker login ghcr.io -u <username>

# Tag the image with the correct format
docker tag dai-pw-02 ghcr.io/<username>/dai-pw-02:latest

# Publish the image on GitHub Container Registry
docker push ghcr.io/<username>/dai-pw-02:latest
```

##### Running the image

The container simply runs the jar file with the provided arguments so the
following lines do the same thing

```bash
docker run --rm -v "./data:/data" dai-pw-02:latest --help
java -jar simpft-1.0.jar --help
```

###### Server

You can run the server either manually using

```bash
docker run --rm           \
  -p 127.0.0.1:1234:1234  \
  -v "./server-data:/data"\
  dai-pw-02:latest       \
  --mode server           \
  --address 0.0.0.0       \
  --root-dir /data        \
  --connections 2
```

Or with the [compose.yml][compose]

```bash
docker compose up server
```

And watch the container's logs:

```bash
docker compose logs -f server
```

###### Client

When using the client, you should run the container manually.

```bash
docker run --rm -v "./client-data:/data" dai-pw-02:latest --mode client -a <server-address>
```

Or with the [compose.yml][compose]

```bash
docker compose run client
```

##### Demo

The demo is done using the `compose.yml` file at the root of the repository and
the content of `client-data` and `server-data`. You can use the `--build` flag
if you want to build the image yourself otherwise the `compose.yml` is already
setup to pull the latest version from the [GitHub Container Registry](https://github.com/Thynkon/dai-pw-02/pkgs/container/dai-pw-02)

> [!NOTE]
> To properly check if the file content you need to have another terminal open or
> use a multiplexer such as [zellij](https://zellij.dev) or [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux)

[![asciicast](https://asciinema.org/a/mlgXHZX7MviE3ArVzCsYEnHHo.svg)](https://asciinema.org/a/mlgXHZX7MviE3ArVzCsYEnHHo)

```sh
# Start the server
docker compose up -d server

# Display the server logs (on another terminal)
docker compose logs -f server

# Start the client interactively
docker compose run --rm client
```

> [!NOTE]
> Now, both the client and server should show that the connection was established
> and the client shows the `>` symbol to indicate that it is waiting for user input.
> each line that starts with `>` here is a command that's sent through the client.

```sh
# List the content of the current working directory on the remote
> list .
